# DevOps is a recognition that development and operations must stop working in silos. They have to start working together. DevOps is the practice of development and operation engineers working together during the entire development lifecycle, following lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver software in a rapid and continuous manner.

# To do that, we need to change to a culture of collaboration that values openness, trust, and transparency. We must adopt a new application design that does not require entire systems to be redeployed just to add a single function.
# How do you change a culture?
# You must change the way people think. They have to start thinking differently. You need to think about social coding and sharing. You have to change the way they work. They need to start working differently. Working in small batches and using test-driven and behavior-driven development. You must change the way you are organized. You must change your measurement system and measure differently because you always get what you measure.
